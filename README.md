Recruitment conversation-starter
================================
This brief assignment has the purpose of providing something tangible to talk about during recruitment interviews for a position as a systems developer.

When it comes to bringing a new developer on board, it is important to ensure that it is a good fit in terms of both technical competencies and development practice.

Expectations
------------
The first is the practice of developing software: How you handle yourself in a terminal, using software versioning systems, IDEs of preference, working in agile teams, meeting deadlines, keeping updated on current developments within the field etc. 
This is the stuff that keeps the wheels turning, and it’s just about as important to us as programming skills.

Which brings us to the second aspect, namely technical competence: Experience, knowledge and awareness of best practices on relevant development stacks. Languages, algorithms, paradigms and patterns. System architecture, frameworks, entity-relation-diagramming, database design. Security. Community participation and contributions to Open Source projects.

The interview assignment
------------------------
In order to assess your competences in the two aspects above, we have formulated a brief assignment that can form the basis of conversation. We are aware that you have your own things going on, and this shouldn’t take more than a couple of hours to do. Remember that it is a basis for conversation, not a billable client project.

Focus on: Showcasing interesting use of technology, using standard components and patterns, following code standards, writing tests and documentation, and using your code versioning software well. Remember that we value both practice and technical competency.

Think about: What you want to talk about when we do the interview. It doesn’t matter if your implementation is not very fleshed out, if we feel that you have thought different solutions through and can argue for/against them.

With that in mind, to the task:

_*Write a piece of software that can take large Apache log files, parse them, and put them in a normalized database, so that they can be used for statistical analysis*_

We are interested in aggregating traffic per client IP/host, in bucket intervals of one day.

If you wish, you can focus on making a fast, parallelized log parser, or build statistical analysis or something else that you find interesting. Feel free to impress.

There are some decent sample Apache data available from NASA here: http://ita.ee.lbl.gov/html/contrib/NASA-HTTP.html

*Requirements*
* Stack should include PHP/Symfony, Ruby, Python or Go  - your choice.
* Hand in by sending us a link to a publicly available fork of this repository showing both code and commit history.

That’s it! We look forward to seeing what you can do!
